# 5010-Final-Project

## Goal
For my final project I decided to re-create Atari's Asteroids in Love2D using lua. My goal is to finish the core mechanics and experiment with shaders if there is time at the end. I also want to learn how to use Love2D to determine whether or not I would want to make my own game using it and find out what the pros and cons are when compared to engines like unity and unreal.

## Play Instructions
Download the zip file -> extract zip file -> launch Asteroids.exe

## Evaluation
I think I was somewhat successful in my re-creation of Asteroids. I started with coding the movement which predictably took a while. Throughout this process I had to look up a lot of math. The movement took a lot of vector math to work correctly, but with some online resources and trial and error I was able to figure it out. I then messed with the physics of the movement until I was happy with how it felt. I then made a simple menu screen, pause functionality and asteroids for the player to shoot and interact with. I learned a lot about how to use Love2D for this project namely its use case when compared to other game engines. Love2D feels like it gives you a lot of control, it doesn't feel like I am fighting the engine as much as it does in unity for example. There are some downsides though, the lack of a viewport to see the project visually is definetely a limitation especially when making more complex games with multiple scenes. Overall I am leaving this class with an enhanced undertanding of creative coding principles and have learned how to use a new game engine which I think is really cool.
