# 5010-Final-Project

## Concept
For my final project I decided to re-create Atari's Asteroids in Love2D using lua. My goal is to finish the core mechanics and experiment with shaders if there is time at the end. I also want to learn how to use Love2D to determine whether or not I would want to make my own game using it and find out what the pros and cons are when compared to engines like unity and unreal.

## Evaluation
